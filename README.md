## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned that, when writing clean, versatile and reusable CSS on a mobile-first approach, the changes needed for a desktop layout in the media queries are minimal. I also stand by the principle that using React to build components is a great way to keep the code clean and organized. I also stand by the idea that Tailwind CSS is a great way to speed up the development process. Finally, I felt very comfortable with the use of the useState hook for multiple purposes, including the building of the keyboard navigation feature, which makes it accessible to all users.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on mobile-first development, since I find it especially important nowadays with our current navigation habits. I also want to focus more on the use of different React hooks, and on accesibility best practices.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Definitely the Tailwind CSS documentation is a must for me as I go, and to anyone who hasn't yet reached the point of knowing every single style name by heart.
